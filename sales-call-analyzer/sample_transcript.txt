**Michael Torres:** It depends on the complexity, but... we're competitive with the market.

**Sarah Chen:** Sure, but I'm curious about the actual timeframe. Are we talking hours, days?

**[02:00] Michael Torres:** *sighs* Currently it's... it can take up to five days for complex commercial lines. Sometimes longer if we need additional information.

**Sarah Chen:** Five days. And what role does data play in your business during that process?

**Michael Torres:** Data is critical, obviously. We're an insurance company. Everything we do is based on data and risk assessment.

**[02:30] Sarah Chen:** Of course. What data sources are you pulling from today? What does your tech stack look like?

**Michael Torres:** We're still evaluating our technology roadmap, so I can't get into all the specifics, but we have our core systems - policy admin, claims management, the usual enterprise setup.

**Sarah Chen:** I understand. But in terms of the data that feeds into your pricing models specifically - are you using external data sources, internal historical data, or a combination?

**[03:00] Michael Torres:** *pause* Look, our models are... they're built on historical data primarily. We do supplement with some external sources, but our actuarial foundation is solid.

**Sarah Chen:** When you say historical data, how far back does that go?

**Michael Torres:** Our models were built about... well, they're mature models. We've been refining them over time.

**Sarah Chen:** Michael, can you help me understand - when were the core models actually built?

**[03:30] Michael Torres:** *reluctantly* The foundational models are about ten years old, but like I said, we've been updating them.

**Sarah Chen:** Got it. And what does your team structure look like? Who are you working with on these pricing initiatives?

**Michael Torres:** I have a team of actuaries and underwriters. We work closely with IT on system implementations. I report to the Chief Actuary, Janet Williams.

**[04:00] Sarah Chen:** And what works well with your current setup? What are you happy with?

**Michael Torres:** Our underwriters are experienced, they know the business. Our loss ratios are... they're within acceptable ranges for most lines.

**Sarah Chen:** That's good. What doesn't work as well as you'd like?

**Michael Torres:** *pause* Well, everything can be improved, right? We're always looking to optimize.

**[04:30] Sarah Chen:** Sure, but specifically - what's the biggest roadblock you're facing today?

**Michael Torres:** Compliance and audit trails are critical for us. Any changes we make have to be thoroughly documented and defensible to regulators.

**Sarah Chen:** I understand the regulatory requirements. But from an operational standpoint, what's preventing you from hitting your goals?

**[05:00] Michael Torres:** *sighs* Look, the manual processes are... they're time-intensive. Our underwriters spend probably 60% of their time on calculations that could potentially be automated.

**Sarah Chen:** Now we're getting somewhere. 60% of their time on manual calculations. How does that impact your ability to compete?

**Michael Torres:** We've lost some competitive deals because our pricing turnaround time isn't as fast as some of the digital insurers.

**[05:30] Sarah Chen:** How many deals would you estimate you've lost due to speed issues?

**Michael Torres:** It's hard to quantify exactly, but it's becoming a more frequent issue.

**Sarah Chen:** And how do you collaborate across teams today? Between actuarial, underwriting, IT?

**Michael Torres:** We have regular meetings, email, the usual channels. It's not always seamless, I'll admit.

**[06:00] Sarah Chen:** Have you been able to quantify what the data and pricing optimization could be worth to your business?

**Michael Torres:** We're working on that analysis. Janet - the Chief Actuary - she understands the technical limitations we're dealing with.

**Sarah Chen:** What specific KPIs are you looking to improve?

**Michael Torres:** We'd like to reduce our pricing turnaround time, improve our loss ratios, increase our quote-to-bind conversion rates.

**[06:30] Sarah Chen:** Can you put some numbers around those goals?

**Michael Torres:** *pause* Ideally, we'd like to get pricing turnaround down to same-day or even within hours for standard submissions. Maybe improve loss ratios by 10-15%. And our quote-to-bind ratio... if we could increase that by 20-25%, that would be significant.

**Sarah Chen:** Those are substantial improvements. Does this align with a larger company initiative?

**[07:00] Michael Torres:** Yes, we're in the middle of a digital transformation initiative. The board has made it clear that modernizing our pricing models is a priority.

**Sarah Chen:** What's driving the urgency now? Why not continue with the current approach?

**Michael Torres:** The market is changing. InsurTech companies are moving faster than us. Our current models don't reflect modern risk factors.

**[07:30] Sarah Chen:** What happens if you don't address this?

**Michael Torres:** We'll continue to lose market share to more agile competitors. The manual processes simply can't compete with digital insurers who can provide instant quotes.

**Sarah Chen:** So let me summarize what I'm hearing - you've got pricing models built on ten-year-old data, underwriters spending 60% of their time on manual calculations, and you're losing competitive deals because of slow pricing. Is that accurate?

**[08:00] Michael Torres:** *reluctantly* Yes, that's a fair assessment.

**Sarah Chen:** You mentioned it could be better earlier. Tell me more about what 'better' looks like for you.

**Michael Torres:** Better would be having pricing models that reflect current risk factors, automated calculations that free up our underwriters to focus on complex risks, and the ability to provide competitive quotes quickly.

**[08:30] Sarah Chen:** Typically we see three main challenges for insurance companies your size - outdated actuarial models that don't incorporate modern data sources, manual pricing processes that can't scale, and lack of real-time risk assessment capabilities. Do any of those resonate?

**Michael Torres:** All of them, actually. But any solution has to be explainable and auditable. We can't have black box models that regulators can't understand.

**[09:00] Sarah Chen:** Absolutely. What other areas would you like to improve? Why?

**Michael Torres:** Integration is critical. We can't have standalone systems that don't talk to our policy admin platform. And we need model transparency - our actuaries need to understand how the models work.

**Sarah Chen:** Makes sense. What about data quality and enrichment?

**[09:30] Michael Torres:** That's definitely an area for improvement. We're not leveraging all the external data sources we could be.

**Sarah Chen:** So let me make sure I understand the key challenges - you mentioned outdated models built on old data, manual processes eating up 60% of underwriter time, and slow pricing causing competitive losses. Would you add anything else or expand on any of those?

**[10:00] Michael Torres:** I'd add that we need better integration capabilities and we must maintain model explainability for regulatory compliance.

**Sarah Chen:** Perfect. So you're looking at five main areas - modernizing your actuarial models, automating manual processes, speeding up pricing turnaround, improving system integration, and maintaining regulatory compliance with explainable models.

**Michael Torres:** That's right.

**[10:30] Sarah Chen:** Great. So let me share how we typically address these challenges. We provide an AI-powered pricing platform that modernizes actuarial models while maintaining full explainability and audit trails for regulatory compliance.

**Michael Torres:** Okay, I'm listening.

**Sarah Chen:** For your first challenge - the outdated models - our platform can incorporate real-time data sources and modern risk factors while showing exactly how each variable impacts pricing decisions. Everything is transparent and auditable.

**[11:00] Sarah Chen:** For the manual processes consuming 60% of underwriter time, we automate the routine calculations while flagging complex cases that need human expertise. This frees up your team to focus on high-value activities.

**Michael Torres:** How does that work with our existing systems?

**Sarah Chen:** That addresses your integration concern. Our platform has pre-built connectors for major policy admin systems, so it integrates seamlessly without disrupting your current workflow.

**[11:30] Sarah Chen:** For the speed issue, we can reduce pricing turnaround from five days to two hours for standard submissions while maintaining accuracy.

**Michael Torres:** Two hours? That's a significant improvement.

**Sarah Chen:** Exactly. And because everything is explainable, you maintain full regulatory compliance. We actually worked with a similar P&C insurer in the Southeast who had the same challenges - they were losing deals due to slow pricing and had models built on old data.

**[12:00] Sarah Chen:** Within six months, they reduced pricing time by 95%, improved their loss ratio by 18%, and increased quote-to-bind conversion by 30%. Their regulators were actually impressed with the transparency of the new models.

**Michael Torres:** That's interesting. How did they handle the change management aspect?

**Sarah Chen:** Great question. We work closely with actuarial teams to ensure they understand and trust the new models. It's not about replacing expertise, it's about augmenting it with better data and automation.

**[12:30] Sarah Chen:** Did that make sense? Any questions about how we'd address those specific challenges?

**Michael Torres:** It sounds promising, but I'd need to understand the actuarial methodology in more detail. And Janet would need to be involved in any technical discussions.

**Sarah Chen:** Absolutely. That's exactly why I'd like to set up a technical discovery session where we can dive deeper into the actuarial approach and get Janet involved.

**[13:00] Sarah Chen:** What would be the best way to structure that conversation?

**Michael Torres:** I'd want Janet there, maybe one of our senior actuaries, and someone from IT to discuss integration requirements.

**Sarah Chen:** Perfect. How's your calendar looking for next week? I can bring our Chief Actuary and our integration specialist to address the technical questions.

**Michael Torres:** Let me check with Janet's schedule. Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon would probably work best.

**[13:30] Sarah Chen:** I'll send you some calendar options. Before we wrap up, do you have budget authority for a pricing optimization initiative like this?

**Michael Torres:** I have authority up to $1M for pricing initiatives, but anything larger would need board approval.

**Sarah Chen:** Understood. And just to confirm, the key decision criteria would be regulatory compliance, integration capabilities, and model explainability?

**[14:00] Michael Torres:** Yes, plus proven results and ongoing support. We can't implement something and then be left on our own.

**Sarah Chen:** Makes sense. We provide full implementation support and ongoing optimization services. 

**Michael Torres:** Good. I think the technical session would be valuable.
